Create a simple banking app.
There should be a bank Class
It should have an arraylist of Branches
Each Branch should have an arraylist of Customers
The Customer Class should have an arraylist of Doubles (Transactions)

Customer:
-Name && the ArrayList of doubles (Transactions)

Branch:
-Need to be able to add a new customer and initial transaction amount.
-Needs to add additional transactions for that customer/branch

Bank:
-Add new Branches.
-Add customer to that branch with initial transaction
-Add transactions for an existing customer for that branch
-Show a list of customers for a particular branch and optionally, a list of their transactions.

Demonstrate autoboxing and unboxing in your code.

*** Hint: Transactions
    -Add data validation.
    e.g check if exists or does not exists, etc.
    Think about where you are adding the code to perform certain actions.
